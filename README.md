Implementation-of-Dictionary-Using-Trie-Data-Structure
======================================================

A Trie or a Prefix Tree is an ordered tree data-structure used to store associative arrays where the keys are usually strings. This was implemented in such a way that it could be used just as any other container in the Standard Template Library of C++. It is commonly used in Dictionary representation as it poses an advantage over space-complexity by its structure
